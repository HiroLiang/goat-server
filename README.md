Goat-Chat Application Server
===

## Introduction

---

Goat-Chat is a personal practice project of Tauri desktop application with Ollama agent. 
I use GoLang to be its server side.

## Planing

---

- User authentication
- Chat control (websocket, LLM redirect, chat group switcher...)
- Just for practice. Other features are on the road... Maybe to send order to resp berry pi IOT?
